# Crredit Card Approval using Decision Tree

Applied decision tree algorithm on the [Credit Card Approval Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/credit-screening/crx.data) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Attribute names are available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/credit-screening/crx.names).

Used different values for the hyper-parameter max_depth (0 to 5) and different criterion specification (Gini impurity and entropy)

Examined overall accuracy score with different max_depth values and different criterion specification.
